# FIRST THING’S FIRST.


This is not meant to be a professional document, this is the deranged ramblings of a 16 year old making a recreation of a game from the 90’s in a drag and drop programming environment disguised as a professional document. This assumes you have a kindergarten level knowledge of Scratch and the Sonic fan game community.


# PenguinSonic


PenguinSonic is a work-in-progress recreation of Sonic the Hedgehog (1991) in PenguinMod. Its goal is to recreate Sonic the Hedgehog as accurately as possible according to [the disassembly](https://github.com/sonicretro/s1disasm), just to see if it's possible. What is currently completed is found [on the official website](sites.google.com/penguinsonic/progress), or [the official changelog](sites.google.com/penguinsonic/changelog).  


## What is PenguinMod


Since people may not know, [PenguinMod](penguinmod.com) is a modified version of the [Scratch 3.0](scratch.mit.edu) programming environment, based on the source code of [TurboWarp](www.turbowarp.org) It adds a wide variety of features on top of the quality of life improvements that TurboWarp provides.


## How to play PenguinSonic


PenguinSonic can be played directly on [PenguinMod.](penguinmod.com) It can also be played on [the game's website](sites.google.com/penguinsonic). For offline use, there is a [separate section of the website](sites.google.com/penguinsonic/downloads) where you can download the game. The recommended download is the HTML5 version that you can open in any browser, but for Windows, an .exe version is also provided.


The first time you play PenguinSonic, the game will require you to provide a copy of _Sonic the Hedgehog_. To provide the file, you have to follow these steps.


1. Legally obtain a copy of _Sonic the Hedgehog_ in the .bin file format.


2. Open the .bin file in a regular text editor, like Notepad.


3. Copy and paste the text from the text editor into the text box provided by PenguinSonic.


4. PenguinSonic will now run a check to prove that the provided ROM file is _Sonic the Hedgehog_ REV00 or REV01.


You will not be asked again (unless you play on the PenguinMod website without an account.)


## Why PenguinMod, not OG Scratch?


PenguinMod has a few advantages over Scratch for a project like PenguinSonic.


1. PenguinMod allows for modifying the FPS, in this case, 60. Scratch is locked to 30.


2. PenguinMod allows for modifying the resolution, in this case, 320x240. Scratch is locked to 480x360.


3. PenguinMod is built off of TurboWarp, so it compiles code to JavaScript, while Scratch interprets the code via HTML5, making PenguinMod 10 to 100 times faster, which is great because some things this game does are very expensive and would run poorly on Scratch.


4. PenguinMod has more blocks and extensions than Scratch does, and more flexibility overall.


5. It's my game, not yours.


## Contingency Plan


PenguinMod is still relatively young, and honestly, I'm not entirely convinced it's going to stay around forever, given certain factors I will not name. In the case of PenguinMod shutting down, or other external factors, PenguinSonic will at least attempt to continue development.


In case the site shuts down, I will most likely continue where I left off using the Offline Editor for PenguinMod.


If for some reason this does not suffice, I will start the process of porting PenguinSonic to TurboWarp, most likely under the name WarpSonic.


In the improbable case that something happens to PenguinMod and TurboWarp, which is, again, very unlikely, I will begin the process of porting and adapting PenguinSonic to vanilla Scratch, but in that scenario, the likelihood of the project working well is very slim.


## GitHub


GitHub is mostly used for Puffin builds, which are weekly betas released on Tuesdays at 12:00 AM UTC. Major builds can be found there too, but the website is the recommended place to find these.
